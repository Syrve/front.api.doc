Added property to API V8 [`FastCode`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Assortment_IProductGroup_FastCode.htm) for [`IProductGroup`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/Properties_T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Assortment_IProductGroup.htm), which allows you to sort by the existing field "Speed ​​dial code in SyrvePOS" for product groups by analogy with products.
