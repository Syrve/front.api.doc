A new method has been added to the V8 API
[`CashRegisterDrawerIsOpened()`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/M_Resto_Front_Api_IOperationService_CashRegisterDrawerIsOpened.htm) 
has been added to the V8 API to get the cash drawer open status passed to the [`ICashRegisterInfo`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Device_ICashRegisterInfo.htm) method. 

The command returns `true` when the cash drawer is open and `false` when it is closed.
