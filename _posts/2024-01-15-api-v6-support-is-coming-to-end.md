The release of API V6 took place in the fall of 2019.
Later, in January 2022, the V7 version was released, since then V6 has been listed as obsolete.
Progress cannot be stopped, and starting from the winter of 2024, Syrve POS builds with V8 support will be released,
which means that V7 will become obsolete and V6 will no longer be supported
(more details [version control]({{ site.baseurl }}/versioning.html)).

If you still have plugins on V6, now is the time to move them to V7.
this version is supported by all Syrve POS released since January 2020 (7.9+),
and will be supported until the fall of 2025.
