Starting from API V9Preview5, the dependency on System.Drawing.Common has been removed because this nuget [is supported only on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only).

Also, the `TryGetProductMenuBitmap` method was removed from [IProduct](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v9/html/Methods_T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Assortment_IProduct.htm), and the `TryGetProductGroupMenuBitmap` method was removed from [IProductGroup](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v9/html/Methods_T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Assortment_IProductGroup.htm). To obtain an image from its byte array, you can use the code from [SamplePlugin](https://github.com/syrve/front.api.sdk/blob/master/sample/v8/Resto.Front.Api.SamplePlugin/WpfHelpers/ImageBytesToBitmapConverter.cs) or use [any convenient](https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only#recommended-action) graphics library.
