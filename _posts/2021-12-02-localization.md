Starting from API V7, when the application starts, plugins will automatically receive language settings from the terminal settings.
Also, to track language switching on a running terminal, an event has been added [`INotificationService.CurrentCultureChanged`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_INotificationService_CurrentCultureChanged.htm).

(see more details [Localization]({{ site.baseurl }}/v7/en/Localization.html)).
