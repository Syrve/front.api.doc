In API V8Preview6 for the method [`ChangeSelectiveDiscount`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/M_Resto_Front_Api_Editors_IEditSession_ChangeSelectiveDiscount.htm) was added [`overload`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/M_Resto_Front_Api_Editors_IEditSession_ChangeSelectiveDiscount_1.htm). This overload allows you to pass a list of pairs consisting of Id elements of the order and the corresponding discount amounts that need to be assigned to them.
