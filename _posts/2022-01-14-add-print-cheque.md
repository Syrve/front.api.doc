In API V8 in the interface [`IPaymentType`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Payments_IPaymentType.htm) new property added [`IPaymentType.PrintCheque`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Payments_IPaymentType_PrintCheque.htm), which shows whether the payment type is fiscal or not.
