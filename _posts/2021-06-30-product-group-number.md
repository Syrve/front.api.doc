In API version V7Preview6 for a product group it became possible to find out its article number
[`IProductGroup.Number`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Assortment_IProductGroup_Number.htm).
Previously, the SKU was only available for the product
[`IProduct.Number`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Assortment_IProduct_Number.htm).
