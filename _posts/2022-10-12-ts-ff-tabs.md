title: Improvements for quick check in the "Restaurant" service type
layout: default
---

In API V8, it became possible to distinguish an order created in quick check mode from an order for a table. And also create this or that order or convert them.

A new property has been added to the order
[`IOrder.IsFastFoodOrder`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Orders_IOrder_IsFastFoodOrder.htm),
which indicates whether the order was created in the Fast Food service type or whether the order was created as a quick check in the Restaurant service type.
For tabs this property is also set to `true`, so an additional check for tabs remains checking the property
[`IOrder.TabName`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Orders_IOrder_TabName.htm) 
to `null`.

In method
[`CreateOrder`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/M_Resto_Front_Api_Editors_IEditSession_CreateOrder.htm)
there is a new optional argument with a default value: `bool? isFastFoodOrder = null`.
If you set its value to `true`, the order will be displayed as a quick receipt. 

A new method has also been added to convert a tab or order created in quick check mode into a table order:
[`ConvertToTableServiceOrder`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/M_Resto_Front_Api_Editors_IEditSession_ConvertToTableServiceOrder.htm).
