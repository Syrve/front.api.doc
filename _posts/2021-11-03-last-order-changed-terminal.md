New property `LastChangedTerminalId` added to order ([`IOrder`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Orders_IOrder.htm). [`LastChangedTerminalId`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Orders_IOrder_LastChangedTerminalId.htm)) and to reserve ([`IReserve`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Brd_IReserve.htm).[`LastChangedTerminalId`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Brd_IReserve_LastChangedTerminalId.htm)), it allows you to determine on which terminal the current state of these objects was saved.

In some scenarios, such as event processing [`OrderChanged`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_INotificationService_OrderChanged.htm), [`DeliveryOrderChanged`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_INotificationService_DeliveryOrderChanged.htm) or [`ReserveChanged`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_INotificationService_ReserveChanged.htm), there may be a need to separate changes stored on the local terminal from changes received over the network from neighboring terminals. Now, to do this, just compare `LastChangedTerminalId` and `PluginContext.Operations.GetHostTerminal().Id`. 

Previously for these purposes was added method [`GetLastChangedOrderTerminal`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v6/html/M_Resto_Front_Api_IOperationService_GetLastChangedOrderTerminal.htm), returning the terminal where the last changes to the specified object were saved. However, between the plugin receiving a certain `IOrder` state and calling `GetLastChangedOrderTerminal`, new changes could have been made on a different terminal, and then the `GetLastChangedOrderTerminal` method would return this different terminal, focusing on a newer `IOrder` state than the plugin has. Now there is no such problem, since the plugin receives the `LastChangedTerminalId` property directly in the `IOrder` object. The `GetLastChangedOrderTerminal` method has been removed.
