In API V8Preview6, a list [`RemovedItems`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Orders_IOrder_RemovedItems.htm) was added to the order information. This list contains a list of dishes that were removed from the order without printing. The API interface was set for these dishes [`IRemovedOrderItem`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/T_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Orders_IRemovedOrderItem.htm).
