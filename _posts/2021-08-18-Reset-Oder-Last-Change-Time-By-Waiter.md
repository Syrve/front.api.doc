Method added to API V7 [`ResetOderLastChangeTimeByWaiter()`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v7/html/M_Resto_Front_Api_Extensions_OperationServiceExtensions_ResetOderLastChangeTimeByWaiter.htm),
allowing you to reset the last time the order was edited by the waiter, thereby removing the problem “The waiter did not approach the table for more than N minutes” from the order.
