Interim release released [V8Preview6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Resto.Front.Api.V8Preview6/8.5.5017-alpha).

Now intermediate releases will be published before the release of the next version of SyrveRMS (in this case, before the release of version 8.5), and the removal of the outdated Preview version will occur one version later.
Thus, the lifespan of one Preview version increases by 3 months.
 
V8Preview6 version will be supported into 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7.
The support period for V8Preview4 and V8Preview5 has also been extended.
The support time for LTS versions of the API will not change and will be approximately 4 years.
Version V7Preview7 will no longer be supported starting from 8.6.
