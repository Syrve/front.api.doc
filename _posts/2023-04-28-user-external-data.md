Added property to Api V8Preview6 [`IUser.PublicExternalData`](https://syrve.github.io/front.api.sdk/v8/html/P_Resto_Front_Api_Data_Security_IUser_PublicExternalData.htm).
This data is not set from the RMS UI.
It is assumed that they are assigned to the business tasks of a specific client.
This data will be written directly to the RMS object `user` via the server API or through special SyrveApp plugins.
