This site presents the API documentation of Syrve POS application (Syrve POS - software for POS terminals, a part of Syrve RMS product).

The Syrve POS application supports functionality extensions with the help of plug-ins. Using a special program interface (API) it is possible to change the program behavior in certain cases: while printing receipts it is possible to attach additional information to them, while entering an order it is possible to duplicate its composition on the second monitor (for the buyer), it is possible to implement integration with external systems of order-taking (web-sites, e-menus, mobile terminals of waiters), to collect statistics and build reports, to connect external payment systems and many other functions.
